        <p>A delicous pancake stack made with pureed banana and topped with blueberries
            and maple syrup.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One ripe banana, mashed</li>
            <li>2/3 cup almond milk</li>
            <li>One teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3/4 cup of 90g 50/50 mix flour</li>
            <li>One teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of blueberries, plus more for topping</li>
            <li>a few teaspoons coconut oil, for the pan</li>
            <li>maple syrup, for serving</li>
            <br>
            <li>1/4 cup of blueberries + a drizzle of maple syrup + tiny pinch of salt (for blueberry topping)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small food processor, puree the banana with the almond milk and vanilla. 
                (or mash it really well by hand - you want it pretty liquified).</li>
            <li>In a separate medium sized bowl, mix together the dry ingredients. Pour the 
                banana/milk mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Gently 
                stir in the blueberries.</li>
            <li>Heat a few teaspoons of coconut oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Using a 
                Â¼ cup measuring cup, scoop the pancake batter into the pan. Flip when bubbles form 
                in the batter (about 1 minute). Let the second side cook for about 60 seconds and 
                remove from heat.</li>
            <li>For the blueberry topping, place blueberries in a small bowl with a little bit of 
                maple syrup. Microwave for 20-30 seconds or until they burst a little.</li>
            <li>Serve pancakes warm with blueberry sauce and maple syrup and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
